# ecchymns

A digital songbook containing the hymns of the Celestial Church in the form of a mobile app.
Work in progress. Need help for UI improvements but most logics and functionalities such as search and viewing song are already implemented. 

App uses Dart/Flutter

The app is connected to a Strapi backend in order to ease future corrections and content updates especially for the yearly hymns program. You have skills in Flutter and feel interested please join in and let's have fun.

Thanks for any interest
